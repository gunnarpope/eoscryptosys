"PKI: It's not dead, just sleeping." -Gutmann

## Purpose
Our current public key infastructure (PKI) is used to secure communications between two parties by publishing the public encryption keys of an individual or organization in a public forum. In order for this system to work:
* Each key must be unique to each individual and cannot be impersonated or spoofed by a 3rd party.
* The PKI must maintain the 'freshness' of each key in real-time. Old keys need to have a way of being retired or distroyed.
* Key owners must be able to prove their ownership of these keys.  


All of this could be accomplished using a blockchain ledger as a public record to publish the encryption keys. The eoscryptosys contract is a simple example.

If this interests you, please reach out and tell me your thoughts. I'd appreciate the feedback.
